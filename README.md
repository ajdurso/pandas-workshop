## Downloading Files

### Recommended: Entire directory

You can download all of the files by clicking the green button above and choosing "Download ZIP."

### Individual Files

**If you download files from the links above, you have to click through to the RAW version of the notebook and download that.  If you download directly from the links above, the files won't open because they are web pages, not the raw files.**

To download exercise/workshop files, right-click on the links below, and choose Save Link As (or the similar option in your browser).  Make sure to choose All file types as the content type (or .ipynb if available), and remove any .txt or similar extensions from the file when you save it.  The files should be *.ipynb files, with no additional file type extensions.


## Exercises

Github user guipsamora has created a repository of pandas exercises for various skill levels, starting from the very basics:

[Pandas Exercises](https://github.com/nuitrcs/pandas_exercises)

Start with the [first set of exercises](https://github.com/nuitrcs/pandas_exercises/tree/master/01_Getting_%26_Knowing_Your_Data/Chipotle) and once you have completed those, pick a set that interests you.  

These exercises were forked from https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises.  If you see issues with the solutions or think something is wrong or could be improved, please [let us know](mailto:m-rich@northwestern.edu) so we can improve them for the next workshop.  We've revised the Chipotle exercises, but there are lots of exercises there that we haven't reviewed yet in detail.
